* TRUONG MINH THINH TECHNOLOGY JOINT STOCK COMPANY | 07/2021 * 10/2023
    * AI Engineer
    * Responsibilities
        * Work in Chatbot team:
            * Design and implement scenarios for the chatbot based on the pre-defined script.
            * Implement and maintain services in Chatbot system and ensure that services logic flow smoothly.
            * Prompt Engineering: leverage LLM to make the Chatbot more power.
        * Research techniques and re-implement them for specific tasks:
            * Implement Question Generation models with context and answer as inputs using some Transformer-based
              architectures.
            * Sentiment analysis: classify user messages to visualize the usefulness and effectiveness of chatbot
              responses. Have experiences in finetuning LLM pretrained models, tweaking model hyperparameters.
        * Use some techniques to increase model inference performance.
            * Using ONNX, TorchScript ... to optimize model performance and inference time.
            * DVC to manage data
